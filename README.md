# React Portfolio Website

This is a website that I developed during my Christmas Break and throughout my fourth semester at EIU. This serves as a capstone project for my college career. The skills and languages used are ReactJS, CSS, C# ASP.NET, Microsoft SQL, Firebase, & Docker.

While this serves as a portfolio page to display my projects and skills, it also serves as a personal "blog" to write about various programming tools I found, music I like, etc.

There are several reasons as to why I picked this as a project. Here are some of the reasons:

1. I needed a portfolio page
2. I wanted to learn how ReactJS works (React Hooks, maps, Single Page Webpages)
3. I wanted to learn how RESTful APIs work and how to develop them
4. I wanted to make a CRUD using ASP.NET and ReactJS
5. I want to combine music and programming together

### Goals for this project

- Dockerize Project



## `Helpful commands`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
